                        <ul>
                            <li>Graduated Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2019.</li>
                            <li>Started research as an RA for a Social Psychology and Neuroscience lab.</li>
                            <li>Continued research, going into and FDA study for concussion clinical trials at sports medicine clinic.</li>
                            <li>Transitioned into more back-ended research coordination with a children's hospital for a year and a half.</li>
                            <li>Then decided that I wanted to try more hands on clinical work (post-pandemic as crazy as that sounds)
                                and became a Neurodiagnostic Technician at Georgetown Universiy Hospital.
                            </li>
                        </ul>Despite all these changes, I look forward to being able to learn something completely new, challenging, and hopefully rewarding in the end! My interest in the unknown was a motivating factor to persuing Neurology and psychology so heavily. I believe that curiosity is what 
                        will drive me to want to know more as I learn to program.</p>

                    <aside class="texts">
                    <p>In my spare time I like to partake in a lot of different hobbies. My background in sports definelty is at the forefront of many of my interests like rugby, running, biking, hiking, and playing extreme tug of war with my 2 year old dog Laika. Aside from all of those things, I also enoy cooking all different types of foods. I also worked at a bakery for 6 years and have absolulet no baking skills. 
                        Traveling is something I love to do more than anything, but with the pandemic and enrolling in a intensive coding bootcamp I'll have to 
                        put that hobbie on hold for a few months. Playing videogames is a more recent interests that I've come to 
                        really enjoy during lockdown, although you wouldn't be able to tell by my poor excuse of any 
                        attempt to play competatively. Meeting new people, and hearing about their lives or interests is something 
                        I really like to do as well.
